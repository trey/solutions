> In case you were unaware, you can also enable spell checking in text inputs (the smaller, thinner inputs where you enter text like the search input on google.com) but it's a little tricky: in your location bar enter <samp>about:config</samp>, scroll down to <samp>layout.spellcheck:Default</samp>, double click that line, change the 1 to a 2, and you're done!
