- Create a folder in `~/Documents` called `TextMate Projects`
- Save your TextMate Project files there (not the projects themselves)
- Change the icon of the folder to what the `~/Sites` folder has (makes sense to me since I use TextMate almost entirely for websites)
- Drag to the right side of your Dock
- Right click the folder in the Dock
    - Display as Folder
    - View content as list

Voil√†:

![TextMate Projects folder in the OS X Dock](http://slog.s3.amazonaws.com/497/TextMateProjects.png)

Note: you'll see `.tmproj` at the end of the project name until the next time you restart your machine or you restart the Dock (`killall Dock`). Not sure what the deal is with that.
