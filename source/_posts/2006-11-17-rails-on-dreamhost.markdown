Follow instructions carefully: [Yet Another Guide to Installing Mephisto on Dreamhost](http://solutions.treypiepmeier.com/wp-admin/post.phphttp://blog.labratz.net/articles/2006/08/19/yet-another-guide-to-installing-mephisto-on-dreamhost)

I had some trouble getting this to work, but I think it ended up being my own fault for not following the instructions to the letter.  I'm going to have to try installing another app and see if it works again.

Note: when [this guide](http://wiki.dreamhost.com/index.php/Rails#Using_Gems_Installed_in_Your_Home_Directory) mentions *gem_name*, don't include `.gem` in the command.  That is all.
