`File > Save for Web & Devices` (cmd+shift+option+s)

On the right side of the screen, you'll see something like this:

![Output settings](/wp-content/uploads/2008/02/output_settings.png)

On the dialog that pops up, choose `Saving Files`

![Saving files](/wp-content/uploads/2008/02/saving_files.png)

Then under `Optimized Files`, uncheck `Put Images in Folder`, or change it to something cooler like `img`.
