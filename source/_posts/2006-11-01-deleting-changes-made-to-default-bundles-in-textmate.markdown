From the Help file:

> If you want to discard local changes then currently the only option is to delete these from ~/Library/Application Support/TextMate/Bundles.

Of course, you can also just drag them out of that folder in case you want to add them back later.  I created a folder called `DeltedChanges` within `~/Library/Application Support/TextMate/Bundles`.
