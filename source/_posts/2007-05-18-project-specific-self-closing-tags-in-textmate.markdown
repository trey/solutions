If you want to switch to using self-closing tags like `<img />` and `<br />` in certain projects, change the shell variable `TM_XHTML` for that project to " ` /`".

**Click here:**

<img src='/wp-content/uploads/2007/05/project_variables.png' alt='Project Variables Button' />

**Enter this:**

<img src='/wp-content/uploads/2007/05/xhtml.png' alt='XHTML for a specific project' />

The default behavior for TextMate is to use HTML 4, so you don't have to do anything extra for those projects.
